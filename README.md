# warnbot-discordpy 
A simple Discord warn bot, written in Discord.py

**NOTE: This is no longer supported, no more updates will be brought over to this. I have since made a full-fledged Discord.py bot, with a separate warn cog, and see no reason why I should carry over with this project.**

## How do I get started?
### The Easy Way (Windows)
[Head over to releases](https://github.com/AtlasC0R3/warnbot-discordpy/releases/), download the \*.exe file and specify your user token, then you should be all right to go!

### The Still Somewhat Easy Way (using Python directly)
Make sure Python is installed and that discord.py is installed through *pip*, then put your token inside data/token.txt and run warnbot.py! You *should* be good to go!

*NOTE: If you want to use a user token (which I think is against the Discord ToS, but anyway), you will have to go inside warnbot.py and change the `bot=True` statement to `bot=False`*
