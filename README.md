# warnbot-discordpy
A simple Discord warn bot, written in Discord.py

# How do I get started?
Make sure Python is installed and that discord.py is installed through *pip*, then run warnbot.py! You should be good to go!
(I'll add a python file to check and install prerequisites whenever I have time and I'm not lazy)
